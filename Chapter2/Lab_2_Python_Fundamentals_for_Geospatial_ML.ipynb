        "In this lab, participants will be introduced to the foundational concepts of Python programming, tailored specifically for geospatial machine learning applications. The lab will focus on building core Python skills for handling geospatial data, developing machine learning models, and automating workflows. Participants will learn Python's syntax, data structures, and key libraries commonly used in geospatial and machine learning tasks through hands-on exercises and examples.\n",

        "Python provides two main types of loops: the for loop, which iterates over a sequence like lists or strings, and the while loop, which continues execution as long as a specified condition is True. For decision-making, Python uses conditional statements such as if, if-else, and if-elif-else to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions, with nested if statements allowing for more complex logic. These loops and conditional constructs are fundamental for controlling program flow, enabling dynamic and efficient execution of repetitive tasks and logical decisions."
